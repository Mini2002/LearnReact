# LearnReact
createElement takes three parameter (element , object , child)
here in the object we can pas anything like the ids className or any attribute
child is the text or anything we want in between the element 
For multiple childs we need to pass array

browser dosent understants jsx its just to make things simpler its being converted to createElement by babel

createElement -> createRoot-> render

React and ReactDOM are objects 

npm init initalize npm
parcel is a bundler like vite 

dev dependency : parcel is a build tool we need it only in Dev not in Prod anything required just for develpoment is dev dependency mean while react will be required in live site or the Prod so its depndency.

Parcel does the same work as CRA minus the bloat and un used files.

package-json : has dependency 
package-lock.json: depency so every person have the same versions installed 
^ ensures to have minor versions changes,  ~ major changes
